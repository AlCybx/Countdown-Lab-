# Countdown-Lab-

## Objective

The objective of the Countdown Lab is to investigate a laptop seized by law enforcement to identify if a bomb threat is real or a hoax.

## Lab Scenario

NYC Police received information that a gang of attackers has entered the city and are planning to detonate an explosive device. Law enforcement have begun investigating all leads to determine whether this is true or a hoax.

Persons of interest were taken into custody, and one additional suspect named ‚ÄòZerry‚Äô was detained while officers raided his house. During the search they found one laptop, collected the digital evidence, and sent it to NYC digital forensics division.

Police believe Zerry is directly associated with the gang and are analyzing his device to uncover any information about the potential attack.

## Questions and Answers

# Question 1
* Verify the Disk Image. Submit SectorCount and MD5.
FTK Imager consistently generates these values in each report it creates, which can be cross-referenced to validate any copy of the logical image, ensuring its digital integrity. This information is located within the Investigation Files folder on the desktop, where the report was generated by FTK Imager. You can locate the answer within the path: C:\Users\BTLOTest\Desktop\Investigation Files\Disk Image\Zerry\Zerry.E01.

# Question 2
* What is the decryption key of the online messenger app used by Zerry?
To identify the online messenger app in question, it's necessary to examine the list of installed applications through Autopsy, where no relevant app seems to be immediately listed. A deeper investigation into Zerry‚Äôs Downloads folder reveals the presence of the Signal Desktop installer, "singal-desktop-win-1.39.5.exe". Further exploration in the file system, particularly under the directory /img_Zerry.E01/vol_vol3/ZerryDüí£üî•/AppData/Roaming/Signal/, uncovers artifacts associated with Signal Desktop. Although Signal employs encryption for its messaging service, the desktop client stores messages and other data in a database, which is secured by a plaintext key stored separately. This decryption key is found within a file named config.json and can be accessed using any standard text editor, enabling decryption of the user's communications.

# Question 3
* What is the registered phone number and profile name of Zerry in the messenger application used?
With the key previously identified, the database containing messages and contacts, located in the file db.sqlite within the directory /img_Zerry.E01/vol_vol3/ZerryDüí£üî•/AppData/Roaming/Signal/sql/, can be decrypted. To decrypt this database, the raw key found must be used with SQLite DB Browser, adding ‚Äú0x‚Äù before the key in the input field. This action decrypts the database, granting access to its tables. The "messages" table reveals the phone number, while the "items" table holds the answer sought for this question.

# Question 4
* What is the email id found in the chat?
Accessing the "messages" table allows for the viewing of all sent and received messages. Within this table, row 21 includes an email address that was sent from the other user.

# Question 5
* What is the filename(including extension) that is received as an attachment via email?
hile the name of the file is not directly mentioned, it can be assumed that Zerry recently interacted with it. Thanks to Autopsty, the shortcut file to the attachment was easily found under Recent Documents in the file explorer window. After extracting the file, the shortcut can be viewed in Windows File Analyzer, showing the linked path the shortcut references.

# Question 6
* What is the Date and Time of the planned attack?
While the shortcut itself does not hold the image, it serves as a point of reference in a report to trace the original image. Given the interaction with the image, Windows creates a thumbnail for it, stored locally. These thumbnails are located at /img_Zerry.E01/vol_vol3/ZerryDüí£üî•/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Explorer/thumbcache_256.db. By extracting and accessing this database through Thumbcache Viewer, the image preview can be visualized and subsequently exported. The information is displayed in clear text, albeit the time is represented using emojis. To interpret the time, consult the emoji keyboard for translation.

# Question 7
* What is the GPS location of the blast? The format is the same as found in the evidence . [Hint: Encode(XX Degrees,XX Minutes, XX Seconds)]
Upon further investigation, it was found that the text containing GPS coordinates was saved on a sticky note on the desktop. The data for sticky notes are located at /img_Zerry.E01/vol_vol3/ZerryDüí£üî•/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/plum.sqlite. There's no need to export this file, as Autopsy allows the encoded text to be viewed directly in its details pane. The text is encoded using ROT13 and can be decoded using CyberChef to reveal the concealed message.
